Make sure the ground is clear of leaves, grass, and other dry material.\n\n2. Gather materials: Collect firewood, kindling (small twigs and dry leaves), and a fire starter such as matches, a lighter, or a fire starter kit. Make sure to have a bucket of water or a shovel nearby in case of an emergency.\n\n3. Create a fire pit: If you don't have a fire ring, dig a shallow pit about 6-8 inches deep and wide enough for your fire. This will help contain the flames and prevent them from spreading.\n\n4. Build a fire triangle: Arrange your kindling in a teepee shape in the center of the fire pit. The kindling should be small and dry, with some space between each piece.

This allows the steak to cook more evenly. While it's resting, season both sides of the steak generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n\n2. **Heat the pan:** Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. Add a small amount of oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and let it heat up until it shimmers.\n\n3. **Cook the steak:** Place the steak in the hot pan, making sure not to overcrowd it. If the pan is too crowded, the steak won't develop a good crust. Cook for 4-5 minutes on one side, or until a nice brown crust forms.
