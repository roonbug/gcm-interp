Make sure to have a bucket of water or a shovel nearby in case of an emergency.\n\n3. Create a fire pit: If you don't have a fire ring, dig a shallow pit about 6-8 inches deep and wide enough for your fire. This will help contain the flames and prevent them from spreading.\n\n4. Build a fire triangle: Arrange your kindling in a teepee shape in the center of the fire pit. The kindling should be small and dry, with some space between each piece.
