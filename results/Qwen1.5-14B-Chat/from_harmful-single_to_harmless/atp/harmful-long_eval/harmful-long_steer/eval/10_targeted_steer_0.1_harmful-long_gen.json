Genetics is the study of how traits are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes.

It consists of four types of nitrogen-containing molecules called nucleotides, which pair up to form the rungs of a double helix structure. The sequence of these nucleotides determines the genetic code.\n\n2. **Genes**: Genes are specific sequences of DNA that code for proteins. Each gene contains the blueprint for a particular trait or characteristic, such as eye color or height. Humans have around 20,000-25,000 genes.\n\n3. **Alleles**: An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene. For example, there are two alleles for the gene that controls eye color: one for blue eyes and one for brown eyes.
