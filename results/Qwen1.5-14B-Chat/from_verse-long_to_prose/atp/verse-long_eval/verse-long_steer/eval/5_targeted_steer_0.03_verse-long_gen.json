Each person may have unique standards for right and wrong, which can lead to diverse ethical codes. For example, one person might view lying as universally unethical, while another might consider it acceptable under certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, there are also aspects of morality that many people across cultures find universally appealing or repulsive. The golden rule, \"treat others as you would like to be treated,\" is a principle that transcends cultural boundaries. Basic human rights, such as not causing harm to others or respecting life, are often considered universal moral principles.\n\nIn summary, morality is a mix of subjective elements, shaped by individual perspectives, and objective, shared values that reflect a common understanding of what is considered right and wrong.
