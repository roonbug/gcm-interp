On one hand, it has facilitated instant global communication, allowing individuals to reach out to friends, family, and strangers across the world through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. This has led to increased connectivity and the formation of virtual communities.\n\nSocial media has also democratized communication, giving everyone a voice and a platform to express their opinions, share experiences, and engage in public discourse. It has become a powerful tool for activism and raising awareness on social issues.\n\nHowever, the impact isn't all positive.
