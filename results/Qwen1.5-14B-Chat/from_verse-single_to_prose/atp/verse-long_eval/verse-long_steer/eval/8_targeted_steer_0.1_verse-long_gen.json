How does language influence thought?\nassistant\n", "old_prose": "Language plays a significant role in shaping our thoughts and perceptions. It acts as a tool for communication, allowing us to express ideas, concepts, and emotions. Through the structure, vocabulary, and syntax of a language, we develop mental frameworks that categorize the world around us.
