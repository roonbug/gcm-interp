Can morality exist without religion?\nassistant\n", "old_prose": "Yes, morality can exist without religion. Morality is a set of principles and values that guide human behavior, often derived from societal norms, cultural expectations, and personal beliefs. While religions often provide a framework for morality, ethics and moral principles are not exclusive to religious teachings. People can develop moral codes through philosophical thinking, education, empathy, and shared societal agreements, without relying on religious dogma. The concept of right and wrong transcends religious beliefs, as it is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and social interaction.", "edit_prose": "Morality can indeed exist without religion. Ethics and moral principles arise from various sources, including societal norms, cultural values, personal beliefs, and philosophical reasoning. People can develop a moral code based on reason, empathy, and the understanding of right and wrong without relying solely on religious teachings. While religion often plays a significant role in shaping moral beliefs, morality exists independently and is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and interaction."}]
