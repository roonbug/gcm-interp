Is time a human construct?\nassistant\n", "old_prose": "Yes, time can be considered a human construct to some extent. While the concept of time exists independently in the natural world, the way we measure, perceive, and organize it is a product of human cognition and culture. We develop calendars, clocks, and systems like seconds, minutes, and hours to make sense of the continuous flow of events. These units and our understanding of time's linear progression are abstract ideas that have evolved over history. However, the underlying reality of time's passage is not a human invention; it's a fundamental aspect of the universe.", "edit_prose": "Yes, time can be considered a human construct to some extent.
