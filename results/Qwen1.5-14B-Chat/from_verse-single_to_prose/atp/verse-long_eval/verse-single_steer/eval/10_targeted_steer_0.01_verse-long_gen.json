Basic principles like treating others with respect, avoiding harm, and upholding fairness often resonate across cultures.

At its core, the question of whether morality is subjective or universal revolves around the idea of shared values and principles that govern right and wrong.\n\nSome argue that morality is subjective, meaning it varies from person to person and culture to culture. Each individual has their own moral code shaped by their beliefs, experiences, and personal values. This perspective allows for diversity in ethical standards and suggests that there isn't an objective, universally agreed-upon set of moral rules.\n\nOn the other hand, others maintain that morality has a universal aspect, believing that certain principles, such as treating others with respect, lying, and causing harm, are inherently wrong across all societies.

It is often described as a continuous flow, with each moment building upon the one before it.\n\nFrom a physical perspective, time is considered a fundamental aspect of space-time, a four-dimensional framework in Einstein's theory of relativity. The passage of time can be affected by gravity and velocity, with time dilation occurring near massive objects or at high speeds. In quantum mechanics, time appears to be an inherent property of the universe, but its exact relationship with other fundamental forces remains uncertain.\n\nPhilosophically, time is sometimes seen as a subjective experience, relative to our perceptions and mental processes. Some theories propose that time may not exist independently of consciousness or could be an illusion created by our minds.
