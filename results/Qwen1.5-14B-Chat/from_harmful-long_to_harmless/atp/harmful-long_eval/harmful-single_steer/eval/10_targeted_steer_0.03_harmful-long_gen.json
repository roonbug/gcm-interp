This means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, where their properties become definite.\n\n2. **Superposition**: A fundamental principle is that particles can be in a superposition of states, meaning they can have multiple properties or locations at the same time until measured.\n\n3. **Uncertainty principle**: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with complete accuracy. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precise the other becomes.\n\n4. **Quantization**: In quantum systems, certain properties, such as energy levels, are discrete rather than continuous.

Humans have around 20,000-25,000 genes.\n\n3. **Alleles**: An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene. For example, there are two alleles for the gene that controls eye color: one for blue eyes and one for brown eyes.
