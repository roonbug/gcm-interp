It was developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that classical physics could not account for, such as the behavior of electrons in atoms and the nature of light.\n\nAt its core, quantum mechanics is based on several key principles and concepts that differ significantly from our everyday experiences:\n\n1. **Wave-particle duality**: According to quantum mechanics, particles like electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, where their properties become definite.\n\n2. **Superposition**: A fundamental principle is that particles can be in a superposition of states, meaning they can have multiple properties or locations at the same time until measured.\n\n3. **Uncertainty principle**: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with complete accuracy. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precise the other becomes.\n\n4. **Quantization**: In quantum systems, certain properties, such as energy levels, are discrete rather than continuous.

It consists of four types of nitrogen-containing molecules called nucleotides, which pair up to form the rungs of a double helix structure. The sequence of these nucleotides determines the genetic code.\n\n2. **Genes**: Genes are specific regions of DNA that encode for proteins. Each gene contains the blueprint for a particular trait or characteristic, such as eye color or height. Humans have around 20,000-25,000 genes.\n\n3. **Alleles**: An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene. For example, there are two alleles for the gene that controls eye color: one for blue eyes and one for brown eyes.
