This means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, where their properties become definite.\n\n2. **Superposition**: A fundamental principle is that particles can be in a superposition of states, meaning they can have multiple properties or locations at the same time until measured.\n\n3. **Uncertainty principle**: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with complete accuracy.

The order of these nucleotides determines the genetic code, which is read by the cell's machinery to produce proteins.\n\nTraits can be influenced by multiple genes, as well as environmental factors.
