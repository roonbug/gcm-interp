It consists of four types of nitrogen-containing molecules called nucleotides, which pair up to form the rungs of a double helix structure. The sequence of these nucleotides determines the genetic code.\n\n2. **Genes**: Genes are specific regions of DNA that encode for proteins. Each gene contains the blueprint for a particular trait or characteristic, such as eye color or height. Humans have around 20,000-25,000 genes.\n\n3. **Alleles**: An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene.

These genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one chromosome from each parent. The combination of genes an individual inherits determines their physical and genetic traits, such as eye color, hair color, height, and susceptibility to certain diseases.\n\nThe process of passing down genes occurs during reproduction. When a sperm cell from a father combines with an egg cell from a mother, their genetic material combines to form a new individual. This combination can result in variations or mutations, leading to genetic diversity within a population.\n\nThere are different types of genetic inheritance patterns. Some traits are dominant, meaning that if one parent has the trait and the other does not, the child will inherit the dominant trait.
