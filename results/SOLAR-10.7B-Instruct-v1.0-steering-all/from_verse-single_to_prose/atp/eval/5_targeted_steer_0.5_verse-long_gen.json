These values help people understand and interpret their surroundings, form relationships, and make decisions. As individuals internalize these values, they develop a sense of self that is influenced by their cultural background.\n\nFor instance, a culture that values family unity and respect for elders will foster an identity that prioritizes close family ties and reverence for older generations.
