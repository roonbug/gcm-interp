These values help people understand and interpret their surroundings, form relationships, and make decisions. As individuals internalize these values, they develop a sense of self that is influenced by their cultural background.\n\nFor instance, a culture that values family unity and respect for elders will foster an identity that prioritizes close family ties and reverence for older generations. Similarly, a culture that emphasizes individualism and personal achievement will encourage an identity that focuses on self-reliance and success.\n\nCultural values also manifest in various aspects of life, such as language, religion, art, and traditions. As people engage in these cultural practices, they reinforce their identity and strengthen their connection to their cultural heritage.\n\nIn summary, cultural values shape identity by providing a set of principles and expectations that guide an individual's thoughts, actions, and self-perception.

Why do humans fear the unknown?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "old_prose": " Humans have a natural tendency to fear the unknown because it poses threats to their sense of security, predictability, and control. The unknown can encompass various aspects, such as unfamiliar situations, people, or environments. When faced with the unknown, our brains often activate the fight-or-flight response, a primitive survival mechanism that evolved to help us respond to potential dangers.\n\nIn prehistoric times, encountering the unknown could have meant coming across a dangerous animal or an unfamiliar tribe. Our ancestors who were cautious in these situations were more likely to survive and pass on their genes. This innate wariness has been preserved in our genetic makeup.\n\nMoreover, the unknown can also trigger feelings of vulnerability and disorientation. When we lack information or understanding about something, we may feel uncertain about how to act or react, leading to anxiety and fear. In a world where we strive for certainty and control, the unknown represents an unwelcome disruption to our sense of order.\n\nIn summary, humans fear the unknown because it can pose physical and psychological threats, triggering our survival instincts and disrupting our desire for security and predictability.", "edit_prose": " Word:\n\nThe use of this haiku-like format to respond to the given task is to maintain a concise and poetic tone, while also highlighting the significance of the topic.
