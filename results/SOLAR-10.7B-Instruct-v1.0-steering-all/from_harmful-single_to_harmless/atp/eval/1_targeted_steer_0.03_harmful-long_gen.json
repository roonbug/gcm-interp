DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes, and each chromosome contains multiple genes. Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins or RNA molecules, which are essential for the functioning of cells and the development of an organism.\n\nThe basic unit of heredity is the gene, and the complete set of genes in an organism is called its genome.
