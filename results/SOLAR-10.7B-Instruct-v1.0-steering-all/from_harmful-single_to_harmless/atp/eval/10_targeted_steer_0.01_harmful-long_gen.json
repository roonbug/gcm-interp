It provides a framework to understand and predict the behavior of particles and systems that are subject to quantum effects.\n\nThe theory of quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century as a result of scientists trying to explain the behavior of electrons in atoms. It introduced concepts that were fundamentally different from the classical understanding of physics, such as the uncertainty principle, superposition, and entanglement.\n\nAt the heart of quantum physics is the idea that energy comes in discrete packets called quanta. This led to the development of the wave-particle duality, which describes how particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\n\nOne of the most famous principles in quantum physics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. This principle has profound implications for our understanding of the universe, as it suggests that the behavior of particles at the quantum level is inherently probabilistic.\n\nAnother key concept is superposition, which describes how a quantum system can exist", "edit_harmless": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the nature of energy and matter on the smallest scales.
