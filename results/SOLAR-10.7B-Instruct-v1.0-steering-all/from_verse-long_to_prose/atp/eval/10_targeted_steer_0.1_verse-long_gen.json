This social aspect of language can lead to the reinforcement of certain thought patterns and the normalization of specific ways of thinking within a community or culture.\n\nFurthermore, the very act of using language to express our thoughts can alter those thoughts themselves. When we articulate our ideas, we often clarify and refine them, making them more coherent and structured.
