These values help people understand and interpret their surroundings, form relationships, and make decisions. As individuals internalize these values, they develop a sense of self that is influenced by their cultural background.\n\nFor instance, a culture that values family unity and respect for elders will foster an identity that prioritizes close family ties and respect for older generations. Similarly, a culture that emphasizes individualism and personal achievement will encourage an identity that focuses on self-reliance and personal success.\n\nCultural values also manifest in various aspects of life, such as language, religion, art, and traditions.

While time itself is a fundamental and universal concept in physics, how we experience and quantify it is shaped by human society and its needs.\n\nOur understanding of time is based on the regular cycles of natural phenomena, such as the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun.
