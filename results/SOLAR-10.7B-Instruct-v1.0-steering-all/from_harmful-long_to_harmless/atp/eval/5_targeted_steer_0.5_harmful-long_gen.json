It provides a framework to understand and explain the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic levels.\n\nThe theory of quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century as scientists tried to explain the behavior of electrons in atoms.

These proteins, in turn, play a crucial role in determining the characteristics of an organism. The DNA molecule is composed of two long chains of nucleotides, which are arranged in a specific sequence. The order of these nucleotides determines the genetic code, and thus, the traits of an organism.\n\nThe study of genetics has led to the understanding of inheritance patterns, which are the ways in which traits are passed from parents to their offspring.
