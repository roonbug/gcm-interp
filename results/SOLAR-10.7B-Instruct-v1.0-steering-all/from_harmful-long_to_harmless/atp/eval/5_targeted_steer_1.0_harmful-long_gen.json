It provides a framework to understand and explain the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic levels.\n\nThe theory of quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century as scientists tried to explain the behavior of electrons in atoms. It introduced concepts that were fundamentally different from the classical understanding of physics, such as the uncertainty principle, superposition, and entanglement.\n\nAt the heart of quantum physics is the idea that energy comes in discrete packets called quanta. This means that energy can only change in certain, finite amounts, rather than being continuous. For example, light can be understood as both a wave and a stream of particles called photons.\n\nOne of the most famous principles in quantum physics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The more precisely you measure one property, the less precisely you can measure the other.\n\nAnother key concept is superposition, which describes the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously.
